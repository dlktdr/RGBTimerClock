# RGBTimerClock
 A RGB Led String Wireless Timing System
 
ESP32 + Arduino RGB LED String Clock. Currently has an Up Counter (Stopwatch mode) Down Count (Timer Mode)

Can have multiple start or stop ESP's. Main idea is a light curtain will start the timer. Another light curtain will stop the timer. Can also start/stop from the handheld and setting the modes and such.

Currently uses ESPnow for wireless communication.

Will switch over to BLE so I can free up the Wifi and incoroprate NTP and use as a real clock too.

Face plate 2 - Needs to have the spacers and diffuser added still, lights are too visible
